Sorts
=====

Timing tests for some sorting algorithms

Sorry for the interface not being very intuitive... hopefully if you can read
the code, you can work out how to run it.

I suggest that you redirect the output to a file (with a .csv extension) and
open with a spreadsheet. Or plot in GnuPlot! 

eg run with "java Sorts 6 > quicksort.csv"

You will probably have to kill the process (with ctrl-c) unless you fancy
waiting forever. Even if you decrease the max value of inputSize, you'll
still be waiting a long time, especially for bogosort and bozosort.
